# Dynamic-Web-Server
CISC 375 - Project 2 - Dynamic Web Server

In this project we built a dynamic web server that renders data from a dataset that holds data about weather apps and smart watches. 
We built three dynamic routes to view the data through. The age route lets you break up the data be certain age ranges (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60+). 
The income route lets you view the data by income range (prefer not to answer, 0-9999, 10000-24999, 25000-49999, 50000-74999, 75000-99999, 
100000-124999, 125000-1499999, 150000-174999, 175000-199999, 200000 and up). The third and final route lets you view the data by service type 
(other, default app, newsletter, internet search, local TV news, newspaper, radio weather, the weather channel). All data is displayed in a table 
based on the route you choose. We also used chartjs to create graphs on our site to summarize key data. To run this project you would have to 
clone the project from the repository. After you have cloned the project from the repository you would have run npm install in the terminal. 
After you have run rpm install in the terminal you would simply have to run node server.js. This will start the server and to view the site you 
would simply use the browser and navigate to localhost:8000 to view the site.
